# Safe
**Safe** is a runtime library that defines a safe context for C++.
It tracks every heap-allocated instance of types that inherit from `Safe::SafeContextBase` and offers recycling/repurpose mechanisms, using only C++ standard library.

## 📥 Download & Installation
Download the library package for your platform.
Extract the package to your project directory and specify the paths to the library's header files. Link to the library files (`.sll`,`.dll`, `.a` or `.so`) by adding to the dependency inputs. If you want to use the dynamic library, copy the library file(s) to the folder(s) of the output executable(s).


> [!NOTE]
On Windows, in order to avoid the confusion between the `.lib` files that go with `.dll` in dynamic libraries, `Safe` will use `.sll` as the file extension for static libraries. Linking to the static libraries with `.sll` extension is fine like linking to `.lib` files in other projects. All library packages are thoroughly scanned with ESET Smart Security Premium on a Windows 10 environment prior to release to ensure they are free of malicious code.

## 💡 Examples
```c++
class Example : public Safe::SafeContextBase //or `class Example safe`
{
public:
	Example()
	{
		
	};
	Example(const Example& other) noexcept
	{
		
	};
	Example(Example&& other) noexcept
	{
		
	};
	~Example() override = default;


	Example& operator=(const Example& other) noexcept
	{
		return *this;
	};

	Example& operator=(Example&& other) noexcept
	{
		return *this;
	};
};

int main()
{
	Example* pointer = ::new Example();
	Example* anotherPointer = ::new Example();
	Example* pointerAlias = pointer;
	Safe::SafeContextBase::recycle(dynamic_cast<Safe::SafeContextBase*>(pointer)); // `pointer` is no longer meaningful after recycling.
	Example& repurposedReference = Safe::SafeContextBase::repurpose<Example>();
	// No need to deallocate via `pointer`, `anotherPointer` or `pointerAlias` anymore. Doing so will lead to program termination or even compilation error(s).

	return 0;
};
```
